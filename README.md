#What is Gif-Project?
Gif Project is a browser based search that uses Giphy's API to pull GIFs.

##How does it work?
By entering in a keyword in the search bar it creates a button.  The created button then uses the GIPHY API to pull relevent gifs.  Test out the default buttons to see how it works!

##What was used to create this?
HTML and Bootstrap were used to create the framework for this site.
Jquery and Javascript were used to create the buttons.
AJAX was used to pull gifs from the GIPHY API.
